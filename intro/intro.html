  INTRODUCTION TO HTML, CSS AND JS

  In this one, I will be publishing things and how to use html, css and js (web development). But fist we have to know little about html, css and js. HTML stands for "hypertext markup language", CSS stands for "cascading style sheet", JS stands for JavaScript

  HTML (hypertext markup language) was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.

  CSS (cascading style sheet) is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web ppages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using css you can control the color of a text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how image to be display, the layout of a page and other variety of other effects. CSS style can be embeded directly into HTML file or seperately into it own file with an extension of .css

  JS (JavaScript) is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. JavaScript can be embeded directly into HTML file, (at the head tag, in the body tag, or before the closing html tag at the bottom) or seperately into it own file with an extension of .js
